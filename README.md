# RS3GP: Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes

**RS3GP** is a Python package that implements Random Fourier Signature Features for Gaussian Processes, enabling scalable kernel methods for sequential data. It provides efficient approximations of signature kernels, facilitating their application in large-scale machine learning tasks.

## Features

- **Random Fourier Signature Features**: Efficient approximation of signature kernels using random features.
- **Scalable Gaussian Processes**: Apply Gaussian Process models to sequential data with reduced computational complexity.

## Installation

To install RS3GP using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tgcsaba/rs3gp.git
```
